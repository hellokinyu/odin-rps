Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors

Really struggled with this project as it was the first time I really wrote any javascript. I understand the importance of writing good pseudocode now, as things can get messy, evem with a project as simple as this.

Though I still feel unsure of many of the concepts and how they are used properly, (and what other ways they can be used), I am already a lot better than before I started this project. I will try my best and keep learning by reading others' code's. KEEP GOING!
